                        Greg Capullo is a self-taught American artist whose visceral, highly detailed, and dynamic penciling style has made him one of the most recognizable and influential artists of the modern comic era. After gaining early recognition at Marvel on titles like *Quasar* and *X-Force*, Capullo was recruited by **Todd McFarlane** to work on *Spawn*, where he served as the main penciller for over 70 issues, defining the look of the iconic Image Comics character throughout the late 90s and early 2000s. He also created his own horror/sci-fi mini-series, *The Creech*, during this period.

                        In 2011, Capullo joined DC Comics for the New 52 relaunch of *Batman*, beginning a legendary collaboration with writer **Scott Snyder**. Their multi-year run is considered by many to be the defining Batman story of the 21st century, yielding seminal storylines like “The Court of Owls,” “Death of the Family,” and the *Zero Year* revamp. This partnership continued to expand into major, company-defining crossover events, most notably *Dark Nights: Metal* and *Dark Nights: Death Metal*, where he co-created fan-favorite characters like **The Batman Who Laughs**. His work is characterized by dramatic action, expressive character design, and a unique fusion of realism and cartoon aesthetic.

                    <!-- Video description -->
                    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">In this conversation with writer and Netflix executive Mark Millar, Greg Capullo discusses his disciplined approach to the industry, emphasizing the importance of treating comics as a full-time job with strict schedules—a commitment he attributes to his fiercely hardworking background. He reveals his surprise move back to Marvel Comics after a long, successful tenure at DC, explaining that his goal is now to prioritize shorter, three-to-six issue arcs to balance creator-owned projects like *The Creech* and *Reborn* with fulfilling his lifelong dream of drawing classic Marvel heroes like *Fantastic Four* and *Wolverine*. Capullo notes that leaving the shadow of Todd McFarlane after his *Spawn* run allowed his personal style to flourish, leading to the unprecedented success of his Batman work.</p>
