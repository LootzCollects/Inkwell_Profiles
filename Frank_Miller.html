                    <p>
                        Frank Miller is one of the most influential comic book creators of the modern era, widely credited with pioneering the gritty, neo-noir style that dominated the industry starting in the 1980s. He began his career in the late 1970s, quickly finding recognition with his definitive run on Marvel's **Daredevil**, where he introduced the iconic ninja assassin Elektra and established the character’s gritty, street-level world influenced by martial arts and Japanese aesthetics.

                    <p>
                        Miller’s career-defining work came in the mid-1980s with **Batman: The Dark Knight Returns**, a revolutionary limited series that reimagined the hero as a brooding, uncompromising vigilante in a dystopian future. This work, alongside Alan Moore's *Watchmen*, shattered the conventions of superhero comics and ushered in the "Dark Age." His independent work, **Sin City**, a series of graphic novels, further refined his unique black-and-white, high-contrast visual language, merging pulp fiction with cinematic drama.
