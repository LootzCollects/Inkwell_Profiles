                        Angel Medina is an American comic book artist known for his highly detailed, gritty, and often expressionistic style, which has made him a prominent figure in horror and supernatural comic genres. His work is characterized by dramatic shadows, muscular anatomy, and a visual intensity that lends itself perfectly to dark and action-heavy narratives. Medina first made a significant mark on the industry in the early 1990s, where his style immediately stood out against the standard superhero fare.

                        He is perhaps most famous for his work on Todd McFarlane's **Spawn** at Image Comics, where he succeeded Greg Capullo and continued to define the character's demonic and tortured aesthetic. This led to his involvement with Marvel Comics, where he had a memorable run on **The Sensational She-Hulk**, and later on *The Incredible Hulk*. Additionally, Medina brought his unique vision to titles like **Kiss: Psycho Circus** for Image/Todd McFarlane Productions, demonstrating his mastery of both grotesque fantasy and superhero action.
