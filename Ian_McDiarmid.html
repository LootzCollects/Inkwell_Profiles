                    <p>
                        Ian McDiarmid is a Scottish actor and director, renowned for his extensive career on the stage—having served as an artistic director for the Almeida Theatre in London and winning a Tony Award for his work. However, to comic convention attendees and pop culture enthusiasts, he is synonymous with the *Star Wars* franchise, having portrayed the overarching villain, **Emperor Palpatine** (also known as Darth Sidious), across every film trilogy in the Skywalker Saga.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        McDiarmid first appeared as the ancient, heavily made-up Emperor in *Return of the Jedi* (1983) and later portrayed the character's younger, charismatic public persona, Senator Palpatine, in the prequel trilogy. This singular, consistent portrayal of the character over decades has made him the definitive face of the ultimate evil in the galaxy. Due to his status as a cinematic icon, McDiarmid is a highly sought-after guest at comic conventions, where he signs a vast amount of memorabilia, including Star Wars comic books from Marvel and Dark Horse, action figures, and posters, making his signature a staple in the comic collecting hobby.

                    <p>
                        The character of Palpatine, thanks in large part to McDiarmid's performance, is a central figure in the expanded Star Wars canon, appearing frequently in comics, novels, and animated series (*Star Wars Rebels*, *The Bad Batch*, *Tales of the Jedi*). His performance defined the dual nature of the character—the charming, calculated politician and the purely evil Sith Lord—a complexity that writers and artists continue to explore in the comic book medium.

                    <!-- Video description -->
                    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">In this panel from Star Wars Celebration 2022, Ian McDiarmid discusses his longevity in the role, noting that he is the only actor to have portrayed his character across all three trilogies. He shares insights into the character's appeal, focusing on Palpatine's mastery of **manipulation and political espionage** rather than physical prowess, which made the role satisfying to portray. He also addresses his final, unexpected return in *The Rise of Skywalker*, confirming that he would be open to reprising the role again if the story was right, demonstrating his connection to the enduring legacy of the Star Wars universe for its dedicated fan base.</p>
