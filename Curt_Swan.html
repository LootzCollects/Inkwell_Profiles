                        Curt Swan (1920–1996) was the preeminent artist associated with 'Superman' for over three decades, beginning in the Silver Age and continuing through the Bronze Age of Comic Books. His long and consistent tenure, which spanned the 1950s through the 1980s, established the visual identity of the Man of Steel for a generation of readers. His art style was characterized by its 'naturalistic, expressive, and humanistic' quality, which softened the look of the character compared to his predecessors and allowed for a wider range of emotions.

                    <p>
                        Swan began his career at DC Comics in 1946 after serving as an artist for the military newspaper 'Stars and Stripes' during World War II. After working on various titles like 'Boy Commandos' and 'Tommy Tomorrow', he became the primary artist on the Superman family of books in the mid-1950s. He defined the look for virtually the entire Superman universe, including characters such as 'Superboy', 'Jimmy Olsen', and 'Lois Lane'. His highly regarded collaboration with inker 'Murphy Anderson' was so consistent and recognizable that the pair's combined work was affectionately referred to as "Swanderson."

                        His legacy is profound; his depiction of the Man of Steel was the version that actor 'Christopher Reeve' famously drew upon for his iconic live-action portrayal. Although he was unceremoniously dismissed in 1986 during the John Byrne-led reboot, his final pre-Crisis story, the celebrated two-part tale "Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?" (written by Alan Moore), is considered a masterpiece and a perfect, poignant send-off to the Superman he defined for so long.
