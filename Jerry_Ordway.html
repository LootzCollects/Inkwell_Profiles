                        Jerry Ordway is one of the comic industry's most versatile craftsmen, highly proficient as a writer, penciller, inker, and painter. His career began in the early 1980s at DC Comics, where he rose quickly to prominence as the definitive inker for major projects, most notably over George PÃ©rez's pencils on the continuity-changing *Crisis on Infinite Earths*. Ordway helped launch and define the Golden Age revival series *All-Star Squadron* (with Roy Thomas), which led to the creation of the superhero team *Infinity, Inc.*

                    <p>
                        Following *Crisis*, Ordway became one of the chief architects of the "Post-Crisis" Superman universe, contributing significantly to the character's new status quo. He first served as a co-plotter and inker, before taking over double duty as the writer and artist on *The Adventures of Superman*. His tenure included the iconic moments of Clark Kent's proposal to Lois Lane (a decision Ordway personally made against the initial editorial plan) and the setup for *The Death of Superman*. In 1994, he masterminded the revival of Captain Marvel (Shazam) in the acclaimed graphic novel *The Power of Shazam!*, which he wrote and painted, leading to a long and celebrated run on the ongoing series.

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-[#541809]">The Power of Creative Flow</h3>
                    <!-- Video summary paragraph -->
                    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">In this interview, Jerry Ordway discusses his childhood entry into comics, sparked by the 1966 *Marvel Super Heroes* cartoon, which led him to win an art contest. He recounts his frustrating early attempt to break into DC Comics in 1977 during the "DC Implosion," and his eventual hire in 1980 after a Chicago convention. Ordway reveals that his favorite stage of the creation process was getting his roughly laid-out and scripted pages back from the letterer; this gave him a "fresh look" at his work after a week's absence, enabling him to start the final penciling phase with renewed perspective and energy, thereby avoiding the creative frustration of facing a blank page. He highlights how this process, which was common in the old "Marvel Method," fueled the collaborative success of the Superman team. He uses the moment where Lois Lane accepts Clark's marriage proposal as an example of a **purely organic creative choice** he made that went against the original script but felt emotionally right for the characters at the time.</p>
