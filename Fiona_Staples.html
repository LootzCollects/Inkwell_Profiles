                    <p>
                        Fiona Staples is a Canadian comic book artist widely regarded as one of the most distinctive and influential artists working today, known for her intricate yet fluid digital work. Her style—which incorporates elements of illustration, animation, and fine art—has garnered her multiple Eisner, Harvey, and Hugo Awards. Since fully transitioning to a digital workflow in 2008, Staples has streamlined her process, preferring to ink directly over loose thumbnails and relying on flat, vibrant color palettes to maintain clarity and speed, which she feels traditional painted comics often lack.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Staples is the artist and co-creator, alongside writer Brian K. Vaughan, of the critically acclaimed and best-selling Image Comics series *Saga*. In this epic space opera/fantasy, Staples has designed every character, vehicle (like the famous wooden rocket ship), and planet. Her preference for drawing **organic forms** rather than mechanical ones heavily influenced the unique visual direction of the series. Beyond *Saga*, she received significant praise for bringing a fresh, modern aesthetic to the classic characters during the popular 2015 *Archie* relaunch.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Her work has been hailed for its emphasis on human emotion and characterization, as well as for pushing boundaries in content and design. Staples has actively used her platform to advocate for greater diversity and more women-friendly content in the industry, inspiring a new generation of creators.

                    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">In this panel discussion from MoCCA 2014, Fiona Staples provides insight into the creative freedom she enjoys while working on *Saga* with writer Brian K. Vaughan. She emphasizes that she has full creative control over the aesthetic of the series, including character and environment designs. She discusses her preference for working entirely digitally, finding that it allows her to skip tight penciling and move quickly into expressive, inked lines. Staples notes that the entire *Saga* series, including the hand-lettered narration, is an "ongoing experiment" between her and Vaughan, focused on creating work that takes full advantage of the comic book medium rather than being easily adapted for film or television.</p>
