                    <p>
                        <b>Stan Lee</b> (born Stanley Martin Lieber) was one of the most recognized and influential figures in popular culture, single-handedly transforming <b>Timely Comics</b> into the global media giant known as <b>Marvel Comics</b>. Beginning his career as an office assistant in 1939, he quickly rose through the ranks and made his writing debut in 1941, using the pseudonym <b>Stan Lee</b> to save his legal name for the "Great American Novel" he aspired to write.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The defining moment of his career came in the early 1960s, known as the <b>Silver Age of Comics</b>, when he pioneered a revolutionary approach to superheroes. Collaborating primarily with artists <b>Jack Kirby</b> and <b>Steve Ditko</b>, Lee co-created characters like the <b>Fantastic Four</b>, <b>Hulk</b>, <b>Spider-Man</b>, <b>Thor</b>, and the <b>X-Men</b>. His genius lay in humanizing these characters, giving them "feet of clay" and real-world problems—such as loneliness, financial woes, and anxiety—making them relatable to a generation of young readers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lee also developed the <b>"Marvel Method"</b> of creating comics, wherein he would provide artists like <b>Kirby</b> and <b>Ditko</b> a rough plot, allowing them creative freedom in the visual storytelling, dialogue, and pacing before he added the final script. This method increased efficiency and production dramatically, fueling Marvel's rise to prominence. Later in his career, he became known worldwide for his numerous <b>cameo appearances</b> in the <b>Marvel Cinematic Universe</b> films and for coining the famous phrase, <b>"Excelsior!"</b>
