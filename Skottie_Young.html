                    <p>
                        <b>Skottie Young</b> is an award-winning American cartoonist, writer, and artist whose distinct, high-energy, and often humorous style has made him one of the most commercially successful creators in the industry. After beginning his career with fill-in and backup work for <b>Marvel</b> and <b>Image Comics</b> in the early 2000s, Young gradually cultivated a unique artistic voice that broke away from traditional superhero aesthetics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        His career trajectory shifted dramatically with his Eisner Award-winning work adapting <b>L. Frank Baum's Oz books</b> for <b>Marvel</b>, establishing him as a top-tier illustrator and leading to his groundbreaking run on <b><i>Rocket Raccoon</i></b>. However, Young is arguably best known for his series of <i>"Baby Variant"</i> covers, which depict adult Marvel characters as humorous infants. These covers became a massive commercial phenomenon, earning him the <b>Inkpot Award</b> and cementing his status as a <i>Marvel</i> cash cow.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Young successfully leveraged his commercial popularity into a celebrated career as a creator-owner. Through his company, <b>Stupid Fresh Mess</b>, he writes and illustrates his hit series <b><i>I Hate Fairyland</i></b>, a dark comedy that satirizes fantasy tropes. His other notable creator-owned works include the emotional Western <b><i>Ain't No Grave</i></b> and the critically praised fantasy <b><i>Middlewest</i></b>. Young is recognized as a savvy businessman, demonstrating how creators can effectively manage their brand and sales independently to retain creative control and maximize profits.

He offers insight into his business philosophy and the importance of <i>not</i> being afraid to break away from superhero norms.</p>
