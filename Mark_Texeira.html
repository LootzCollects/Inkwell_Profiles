                        <b>Mark Texeira</b> (often credited as <b>Tex</b>) is a classically trained American artist celebrated for bringing a gritty, painted, and highly detailed illustration style to the comic book medium. After graduating from Manhattan’s High School of Art and Design, he received a Presidential Scholarship to the School of Visual Arts but dropped out early to pursue a commercial freelance career. His early success in oil painting, including mentions at the Salmagundi Club, deeply informs his comic work.

                        Texeira broke into comics in the early 1980s, but rose to prominence in the late 80s and early 90s, becoming synonymous with Marvel’s darker characters. He is best known for his influential work on <b><i>Ghost Rider</i></b> (Volume 3), <b><i>The Punisher War Journal</i></b>, and <b><i>Wolverine</i></b>, often employing heavy shadow and a textured look that perfectly matched the era's tone. He also created the character <b>Psi-Force</b> for Marvel’s short-lived New Universe line.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        His unique ability to seamlessly blend traditional pen-and-ink superhero art with fully painted pages made him a go-to artist for titles like <b><i>Black Panther</i></b> (with Christopher Priest) and <b><i>Vampirella</i></b>, where his painterly approach elevated the dramatic and dark fantasy themes. Texeira's current focus remains on challenging himself with both classic comic art and high-end oil painting commissions, drawing inspiration from masters like <b>Frank Frazetta</b>.

                    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">In this interview, <b>Mark Texeira</b> discusses his artistic influences, which blend the comic book dynamism of <b>Jack Kirby</b> and <b>Neal Adams</b> with the fantasy realism of <b>Frank Frazetta</b> and classic fine artists. He describes his meticulous creative process, which sometimes involves creating physical reference models of the characters (like the early Disney animators) before committing them to paper. He also reflects on his time living in New York and the current state of his painting and commission work from his home in California.</p>
