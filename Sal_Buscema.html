                        <b>Silvio "Sal" Buscema</b> is one of the most dedicated and prolific artists in Marvel Comics history, having worked for the company for over three decades. Affectionately known as "Our Pal Sal," he is the younger brother of the celebrated artist <b>John Buscema</b>. After initially assisting his brother with inking and backgrounds, Sal broke into the industry himself in 1968, finding fame quickly due to his energetic and reliably clear sequential storytelling style.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Buscema's most defining achievement is his decade-long run as the core artist on <b><i>The Incredible Hulk</i></b> (1975–1985). His fluid and dynamic style, marked by exaggerated action poses (often referred to as the "Sal-Punch"), was perfect for capturing the raw power and underlying vulnerability of <b>Bruce Banner's</b> monstrous alter-ego. This era solidified the character's look for a generation of readers, particularly those who were tuning into the hit live-action television series.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beyond the Jade Giant, Sal is noted for his long run on <b><i>The Spectacular Spider-Man</i></b>, collaborating with writers like <b>Gerry Conway</b>. He was instrumental in launching the ongoing <b><i>Defenders</i></b> series and co-created the villain team <b>The Squadron Sinister</b> (a homage to DC's Justice League). Buscema was a true workhorse, often self-inking his pencils, resulting in a consistent, highly readable style that made him integral to the look of Marvel Comics throughout the 1970s and 1980s.

                    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">In this interview, <b>Sal Buscema</b> discusses his lengthy career, including his training at Manhattan's High School of Music and Art, his military service, and the formative early years when he worked alongside his brother <b>John Buscema</b>. He shares his appreciation for his long run on <b><i>The Incredible Hulk</i></b> and his insights into the evolution of the comic book industry through the <b>Silver and Bronze Ages</b>.</p>
