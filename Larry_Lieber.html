                    <p>
                        <b>Larry Lieber</b> is an American comic book writer and artist whose foundational contributions during the Silver Age helped establish the modern <b>Marvel Universe</b>. As the younger brother of <b>Stan Lee</b>, he began working as an art assistant in the late 1940s and served in the US Air Force before dedicating himself to comics full-time in the 1950s.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He is perhaps best known for his critical scripting and creative work alongside <b>Jack Kirby</b> on some of Marvel’s most iconic heroes. Lieber co-created both <b>Thor</b> (first appearance in <b><i>Journey Into Mystery</i> #83</b>) and <b>Iron Man</b> (first appearance in <b><i>Tales of Suspense</i> #39</b>), giving them their civilian identities as <b>Donald Blake</b> and <b>Anthony Stark</b>. He also co-created <b>Ant-Man (Hank Pym)</b>. Furthermore, he inadvertently created the magical metal <b>Uru</b> (used for Mjolnir) simply by devising a short, exotic-sounding word the letterer could easily fit on the page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lieber’s career also saw a long run both writing and drawing the Western comic <b><i>Rawhide Kid</i></b>, and he holds the record as the longest-running contributor, both writing and drawing, the syndicated <b><i>The Amazing Spider-Man</i></b> newspaper comic strip from 1986 until his retirement from penciling in 2018. In his later career, he achieved a lifelong goal of writing original prose with the publication of his novel, <b><i>Chirps</i></b>.
                    </p>

                    <!-- Video description provided by the user (general topic implied from title) -->
                    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">In this highly personal interview, <b>Larry Lieber</b> reflects on his career, including how his perceived slowness led his brother <b>Stan Lee</b> to offer him the freedom to work on <b><i>Rawhide Kid</i></b>. He shares the charming story behind creating the term <b>"Uru"</b> and the personal motivation for writing his novel, <b><i>Chirps</i></b>, which helped him process grief after his wife's passing. Lieber discusses the creative freedom of writing his own prose compared to the collaborative nature of comics.</p>
