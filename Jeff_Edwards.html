                    <p>
                        Jeffrey "Jeff" Edwards is a professional comic book artist known for his detailed illustration work, with a style influenced by both traditional comic art and animation. After earning a Masters Degree in Comic Book Illustration, Edwards broke into the industry working on articles for *FilmInk* magazine. He has contributed to a wide array of licensed properties, providing covers and interiors for titles like *Transformers*, *G.I. Joe*, and *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles*.

                    <p>
                        Edwards gained significant attention as the artist for the supernatural noir series *Syphon* (Top Cow/Image Comics). His creative philosophy prioritizes an old-school, analog approach: he pencils and inks entirely by hand, only using digital tools (like Procreate) for certain technical elements, such as quick perspective grids, to maintain the raw, tactile feel of original art. He has embraced the growing trend of fan engagement by preserving his pencils and selling both the original pencil art and the final inked pages, recognizing the collector demand for the "behind-the-scenes" process.

                    <!-- Video summary paragraph -->
                    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">In this interview, Jeff Edwards recounts the highly unusual circumstances surrounding his hiring at Top Cow for *Syphon*, an event he jokingly describes as a "trip." He secured a portfolio review at a convention (one of the last held before the 2020 lockdown) where Top Cow President Matt Hawkins hired him immediately, recognizing his talent quickly. Edwards elaborates on the premise of *Syphon*, which follows an EMT named Sylas who gains the power to take pain from others, explaining that the high cost of this power and the ongoing war for the human condition are core to the story's depth. Edwards spent months creating concept art for the vast historical lineage of Siphons across all global cultures. He details his workflow, explaining that he now only reads **five pages of script at a time**, allowing him to maintain peak excitement and energy in the moment for the sequential art before proceeding to the inking phase, which ensures the final product is dynamic and energetic.</p>
