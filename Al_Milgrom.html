                        **Al Milgrom is an American comic book creator renowned for his extensive work as an artist, writer, and editor, primarily for Marvel Comics. Born in Detroit, Michigan, on March 6, 1950, he graduated from the University of Michigan with a degree in art and design in 1972 before beginning his comics career as an assistant to inker Murphy Anderson. Milgrom quickly moved into penciling and inking for various publishers like Charlton Comics and Warren Publishing before joining Marvel, where he would establish his long-standing career.

                        **Milgrom's career spans numerous key roles, highlighting his versatility in the industry. As an artist, he gained prominence penciling Captain Marvel in the mid-70s, and later had notable runs as the penciler on The Avengers, the four-year stint on West Coast Avengers, and drawing the landmark crossover event Secret Wars II (1985â€“86). He is also known for his long involvement as a writer, penciler, and inker on Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man, where he co-created characters like the villain the Spot. Milgrom is also the co-creator of the DC Comics hero Firestorm with writer Gerry Conway during a brief editorial stint at DC in the late 1970s.

                        **His work as an inker and editor is also substantial. Milgrom served as a Marvel Comics editor starting in 1979 and famously edited the anthology series Marvel Fanfare for its entire ten-year run. As an inker, he was prolific across the Marvel line, serving an eight-year stint as the inker on X-Factor and frequently collaborating with penciler Jim Starlin on various projects, often under the joint signature "Gemini." Milgrom has also contributed his talents to Archie Comics and continues to freelance in the industry, maintaining a reputation as a highly experienced and enduring figure in comic book history.
