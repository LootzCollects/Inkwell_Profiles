                    <p>
                        Joe Jusko is celebrated for his highly detailed, realistic painted artwork, which draws heavily from fantasy and classic illustration masters like Frank Frazetta and John Buscema (whom he cites as a major influence). He broke into the industry early, selling his first cover to *Heavy Metal Magazine* at age 17 after graduating from New York's High School of Art and Design. Jusko’s style—characterized by muscular heroes, dramatic lighting, and rich colors—was a staple of Marvel's black-and-white magazine line, becoming one of the premier cover artists for *The Savage Sword of Conan* throughout the 1980s.

                        Jusko’s career reached a landmark high with the 1992 Marvel Masterpieces trading card set. Consisting of 100 fully painted, photo-realistic depictions of Marvel's pantheon, the set was an overwhelming commercial success credited with launching the painted trading card boom of the decade. Though he briefly left the art world to serve as a police officer, he returned to his passion, finding renewed success that led to extensive work on properties like *Tomb Raider*, *Vampirella*, and becoming the most prolific artist for the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs. Unlike many contemporary artists, Jusko works almost exclusively in traditional mediums like acrylics and oil paint, lending a timeless, tactile quality to his dynamic compositions.

                    <!-- Video summary paragraph -->
                    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">In this short commentary, Joe Jusko briefly summarizes his career, highlighting that he broke into the comic industry in 1978 and is celebrated for his work on *The Savage Sword of Conan* and the 1992 Marvel Masterpieces trading cards. He specifies his artistic preference, noting that while he draws many superheroes, he particularly enjoys working on more reality-based characters such as Tarzan, Conan, Vampirella, and Tomb Raider. Jusko finds these characters easier to connect with and attach himself to, leaning into the fantasy and reality-grounded genres for his painted illustrations.</p>
