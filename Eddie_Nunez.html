                    <p>
                        Eddie Nunez is an American artist recognized for his versatile work as a penciler, inker, and character designer across comics, video games, and animation. Born and raised in El Paso, Texas, Nunez was heavily influenced by classic Japanese anime, Western comic books, and video games like *Street Fighter*. This blend is evident in his signature style, which utilizes large, chunky shapes and dynamic posing to give his characters a robust and powerful aesthetic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nunez launched his professional career in 2008 when he was hired to work for WildStorm/DC Comics, focusing primarily on concept design and artwork for **DC Universe Online**. He has lent his artistic touch to numerous mainstream comic titles, including <em>Flashpoint: Lois Lane and the Resistance</em>, <em>Deadpool</em>, <em>Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>, and currently contributes to series like <em>Masters of the Universe: Masterverse</em> for Dark Horse. His background in character design also led him to Austin, Texas, to work on the Netflix animated series <em>Seis Manos</em>.

                    <p>
                        A popular face on the convention circuit, Nunez's influence comes from his ability to adapt classic properties into modern, visually strong designs, making his work highly sought after by fans and collaborators alike. He regularly shares his process and art through conventions and sketchbooks, continually stressing the importance of "keep drawing" to develop an artist's own library of shapes and forms.
