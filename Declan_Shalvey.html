                    <p>
                        Declan Shalvey is an acclaimed Irish comic book writer and artist whose distinct, character-focused visual storytelling and cinematic action sequences have made him a fan-favorite in the industry. Starting his career in independent Irish comics, Shalvey moved to work-for-hire at the "Big Two" (Marvel and DC Comics), where he made a significant impact on titles like <em>Deadpool</em> and <em>Thunderbolts</em>. He is particularly recognized for his transformative six-issue run on <em>Moon Knight</em> with writer Warren Ellis, defining the character's modern look with a striking aesthetic that heavily utilized white space and deep black shadows.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Shalvey transitioned from being primarily an artist to a successful writer and creator, driven by a desire for more creative control and the freedom of creator-owned work. He teamed up with Ellis again for the critically praised Image Comics sci-fi series <em>Injection</em>. In the creator-owned space, he has also written and illustrated acclaimed Irish noir graphic novels like <em>Savage Town</em> and <em>Bog Bodies</em>. His current ongoing passion project, <em>Old Dog</em>, showcases his rare talent as a triple threatâ€”writing, drawing, and coloring the entire series himself.

                    <p>
                        He is highly regarded by his peers for his professionalism and dedication to meeting deadlines, a trait he maintains while balancing work-for-hire on established franchises like <em>ThunderCats</em> and <em>The Terminator</em> alongside his creator-owned titles. Shalvey's influence lies in his ability to blend gritty realism with dynamic superhero action, all while championing the idea that the artist's role is inseparable from the act of storytelling.

                    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">In this interview from NYCC 2024, Declan Shalvey discusses his career path, starting by showing portfolios at conventions before moving to writing his own work. He talks about his current projects, including his "spy-fi" series, <strong>Old Dog</strong>, which he single-handedly writes, draws, and colors. Most notably, he provides insight into his approach to the *ThunderCats* franchise, explaining his decision to give it a more slightly dystopian sci-fi tone to tell new stories and not just regurgitate old ones, even confirming the introduction of brand new characters to the lore.</p>
