                    <p>
                        Jackson "Butch" Guice was an acclaimed American comic book artist known for his versatility, clean draftsmanship, and naturalistic realism that spanned over four decades in the industry. Starting his career in the early 1980s at Marvel Comics, he worked on a variety of titles, including *Micronauts*, *The New Mutants*, and *Iron Man*. His work was celebrated for its taut, cinematic storytelling that deliberately avoided the overly stylized trends of the 1990s.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Guice quickly established himself as a reliable and masterful storyteller at both Marvel and DC. For DC Comics, he played a key role as an artist on the iconic **"The Death of Superman"** storyline, and later cemented his legacy by co-creating the critically praised series *Resurrection Man* (1997) with writers Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning. The series, featuring Mitch Shelley who could not die, showcased Guice’s ability to handle complex action and quiet, introspective drama with equal skill. He also had defining runs on titles like *The Flash* and the unique Victorian-era detective series *Ruse* for CrossGen.

                    <p>
                        Guice was widely regarded by peers and collaborators as a consummate professional, a humble mentor, and a truly exceptional illustrator whose art was admired for its clarity and masterfully composed panels, often described as "old-school without ever being old-fashioned."
