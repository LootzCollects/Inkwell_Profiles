                        George Pérez was an American comic book artist renowned for his intricate detailing, clean line work, and unmatched ability to illustrate massive crowd scenes. His career launched at Marvel Comics in the 1970s, establishing him as a premier talent on *The Avengers* and *Fantastic Four*. He co-created the first Puerto Rican superhero, White Tiger, in 1975. Pérez's style effectively bridged the classic energy of Jack Kirby and Kurt Swann with the realism of Neal Adams, creating a distinct, dynamic feel perfect for team books.

                        He moved to DC Comics in 1980, where, alongside writer Marv Wolfman, he co-created and defined *The New Teen Titans*, turning the book into a flagship title for the entire company. His work on the mega-event *Crisis on Infinite Earths* in 1985 cemented his legacy as a master of continuity, requiring him to draw hundreds of characters in a single story, which successfully streamlined the DC Universe. Following *Crisis*, he reimagined *Wonder Woman* in a critically acclaimed run, serving as both writer and artist and emphasizing her connections to Greek mythology.

                        Pérez returned to Marvel in the 1990s to draw the cosmic event *Infinity Gauntlet* (where he was the first to draw Thanos using the Snap) and later reunited with Kurt Busiek for a lauded run on *The Avengers*. After years of setbacks on an earlier attempt, Pérez finally fulfilled a lifelong ambition, illustrating the historic *JLA/Avengers* crossover in 2003, showcasing his ability to handle the entire pantheon of both universes simultaneously. Throughout his career, Pérez was universally beloved by fans and peers for his generosity, humanity, and kind interactions at conventions.

                    <!-- Video description -->
                    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">This retrospective covers George Pérez’s legendary career, highlighting his influential runs on *The New Teen Titans*, *The Avengers*, and *Crisis on Infinite Earths*. It delves into the infamous political conflict surrounding the initial 1980s attempt to create a *Justice League of America/Avengers* crossover. Pérez completed 21 pages of pencils before Marvel Editor-in-Chief Jim Shooter rejected the plot based on continuity conflicts. This editorial dispute eventually led to the project's collapse, frustrating Pérez so deeply that he signed an exclusive contract with DC Comics for five years shortly thereafter. The video underscores how Pérez’s attention to detail ensured that even the most chaotic crowd scenes were visually coherent and emotionally impactful.</p>
