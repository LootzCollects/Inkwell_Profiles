                        **Kibar** is a French illustrator and cover artist who rose to prominence quickly in the comics scene, marked by his distinctively realistic and high-contrast digital painting and traditional colored pencil work. His exposure began in 2019 when he was a finalist in the Paris Comic Con young artist competition for his **"Long Live Batman"** cover. The following year, his poster tribute to **Zack Snyder's Justice League** was selected for DC FanDome, signaling his emerging talent.

                    <p>
                        Kibar's artistic style is characterized by a "generous" realism that is highly appealing to superhero fans, often employing a heavy contrast between light and shadow. He frequently works on black sheets of paper for his commissions, allowing him to dramatically deepen reliefs and mark the highlights on characters like **Batman** and **Joker**.

                    <p>
                        His primary professional work involves creating official covers for <b>Todd McFarlane's</b> Image Comics titles, including **<i>Spawn</i>**, **<i>King Spawn</i>**, and **<i>Violator: Origins</i>**. During interviews, he has discussed how McFarlane personally reached out after seeing his fan art, leading to his ongoing work on the Spawn Universe. He is influenced by the painted realism of **Alex Ross** and the dynamic compositions of artists like **Gabriel Dell’Otto** and the **Romita family** (Sr. and Jr.).

He talks about the serendipitous story of McFarlane messaging him directly, the creative process behind his detailed and dramatic covers, and his aspirations to draw more characters from the DC and Marvel universes, such as **Superman** and **Spider-Man**.</p>
