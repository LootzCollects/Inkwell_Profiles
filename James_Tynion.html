                    <p>
                        James Tynion IV is an Eisner Award-winning, *New York Times* best-selling writer who has quickly become one of the most influential voices in modern comics, especially in the horror and mystery genres. After studying creative writing under Scott Snyder, Tynion began his career at DC Comics co-writing backup features for *Batman* and soon became a core writer on the Bat-titles, notably co-creating modern characters like **Punchline** and **Ghost-Maker**. He also wrote the acclaimed *Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles* crossover trilogy and a massive run on *Detective Comics* during the Rebirth era.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tynion's influence is strongest in the creator-owned space, where his personal fears and anxieties shape the foundation of what has been dubbed the "Tynion Universe." Early work like *The Woods* (2014) established a blueprint for his themesâ€”melding horror with character-driven adventure. His breakthrough mega-hit, *Something is Killing the Children* (2019), co-created with Werther Dell'Edera, launched the "Slaughterverse" and became one of the biggest independent successes of the decade. This success allowed Tynion to move away from exclusive work-for-hire to focus almost entirely on creator-owned projects, including hits like *The Nice House on the Lake* and *The Department of Truth*.

                    <p>
                        He is noted for his commitment to long-form storytelling and has leveraged his audience success to launch **Tiny Onion**, his own publishing and newsletter venture, pioneering new models for creator-to-fan engagement within the industry.

                    <!-- Video description -->
                    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">In this panel celebrating his decade with BOOM! Studios, James Tynion IV discusses finding his authentic voice in comics and pushing back against editorial constraints he felt while writing superhero books:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4 text-gray-700">
                        <li>**The Woods Blueprint:** He considers *The Woods* (his first ongoing series) the fundamental blueprint for all his creator-owned work, built from his core fears and insecurities from his high school years.</li>
                        <li>***Something is Killing the Children*:** The series began as five intended one-shots, but quickly evolved when he saw artist Werther Dell'Edera's design for **Erica Slaughter** (including the iconic bandanna) and tapped into a deeper story about a protagonist struggling against a failing system. He states the book is designed to run for **100 issues**.</li>
                        <li>**Pushing Boundaries:** Tynion recalls being told in superhero comics not to use dense page spreads or unconventional naming practices. *Something is Killing the Children* was a deliberate rejection of those rules, using dense spreads and withholding Erica Slaughter's name until issue #3.</li>
                        <li>**Long-Form Commitment:** He emphasizes the joy of creating long-running, long-form serials, hoping the industry will support more series that go for many volumes, providing a constant on-ramp for new readers to discover stories.</li>
