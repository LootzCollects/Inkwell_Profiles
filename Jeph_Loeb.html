                        Jeph Loeb is an Emmy and Eisner Award-winning American writer who has achieved major success across film, television, and comic books. After graduating from Columbia University Film School, he moved to Hollywood, where his screenwriting career quickly launched with the hits *Teen Wolf* (1985) and *Commando* (1985). This success led to a project writing a film for The Flash. When that film was ultimately shelved, DC Comics publisher Jeanette Khan invited him to write comics instead, a moment Loeb humorously compares to Santa arriving in July.

                    <p>
                        This pivot led to his foundational comic book career, defined by his decades-long partnership with the late artist **Tim Sale** on iconic "color" miniseries like *Daredevil: Yellow*, *Spider-Man: Blue*, and *Hulk: Gray*. For DC, the duo redefined the Batman and Superman myths with classics like *Batman: The Long Halloween* and *Superman for All Seasons*. His later work included the blockbuster *Batman: Hush* with Jim Lee. From 2010 to 2019, Loeb transitioned to a major executive role as the Head of Marvel Television, overseeing the creation of 14 live-action and animated series, including *Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.* and the acclaimed Netflix shows like *Daredevil*.

                    <!-- Video summary paragraph -->
                    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">In this interview, Jeph Loeb discusses his "lucky" career path, moving from Hollywood screenwriter (writing *Teen Wolf* at age 23) to comic book writer, a job he found "much more exciting than writing movies." He recounts meeting his long-time collaborator Tim Sale at San Diego Comic-Con in 1989 after every other artist rejected his pitch for *Challengers of the Unknown*, noting that Sale was simply "the only guy that said yes." He details his later transition to television, working on acclaimed shows like *Smallville*, *Lost*, and *Heroes*, before being personally invited by Marvel (post-Disney acquisition) to create and run their new television division, resulting in hits like the Netflix series. Loeb emphasizes that the most meaningful part of his convention appearances, which he only recently resumed after a ten-year hiatus, is the direct, emotional connection with fans, who often share that his work, such as *Batman: The Long Halloween*, was the first comic they ever read or a story they shared with their children.</p>
