                        Jim Steranko is an uncompromising and fiercely independent creative force, whose brief but explosive tenure in comics revolutionized the visual medium. Growing up in poverty, he taught himself numerous skills, including drawing by studying newspaper strips, music (playing in rock bands, where he claims to have invented the go-go dancer), and magic (performing as an escape artist). His background in commercial printing and advertising design gave him a unique edge when he broke into Marvel Comics in 1966.

                    <p>
                        Steranko's defining work came on *Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.*, where he took over writing and art duties. He shattered traditional panel layouts, incorporating **Surrealism, Pop Art, Op Art, and cinematic techniques** (like the cinematic wipe and dramatic camera angles) to push sequential storytelling boundaries. His work, described by Stan Lee as "rippling with energy," heavily influenced contemporaries, notably inspiring Jack Kirby's *Mister Miracle* and the visual style of Frank Miller's *Sin City*. After leaving Marvel in 1970 due to creative clashes, he self-published *Chandler: Red Tide* (1976), which he considers the first American graphic novel, and became an influential film production designer, creating the iconic look of Indiana Jones for George Lucas and Steven Spielberg.

                    <!-- Video summary paragraph -->
                    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">In this biographical interview, Steranko asserts that he consciously injected over 150 narrative innovations into his 29 comic books, contrasting his inventive approach with the routine work being done at the time. He details his strategy of delivering pages right before deadline to prevent editors like Stan Lee from altering his work, and candidly discusses the conflicts that arose over his experimental techniques, such as the famous two-page spread for the *Yellow Claw* saga (a four-page image requiring readers to buy two copies). He discusses his belief that comics should draw from the world's greatest film directors, and reveals that his decision to pull his work and leave Marvel was rooted in the company's failure to pay creators for their ideas. He views his legacy not just as a draftsman, but as a groundbreaking narrative designer and philosophical rebel who always fought for the integrity of his vision.</p>
