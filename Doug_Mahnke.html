                    <p>
                        Doug Mahnke is an American comic book artist renowned for his detailed, visceral, and powerful penciling style, which has made him a frequent collaborator on major DC Comics event titles. His career began at Dark Horse Comics, where he co-created the iconic character The Mask with writer John Arcudi, defining the look for the initial run of the cult-classic series. Mahnkeâ€™s unique style balances superhuman athleticism with a raw, expressive energy, lending itself perfectly to both the grim realism of Gotham City and the cosmic scale of the Green Lantern Corps.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mahnke is a veteran of DC Comics, known for impactful runs on titles like <em>JLA</em> and <em>Superman: The Man of Steel</em>. He gained significant recognition for his work on key Batman storylines, including <em>Batman: The Man Who Laughs</em> and the pivotal **"Under the Red Hood"** arc, which brought Jason Todd back to life. He also played a critical role in the DC Multiverse, collaborating with Grant Morrison on <em>Final Crisis: Superman Beyond 3D</em> and <em>Seven Soldiers: Frankenstein</em>, helping to design the character Frankenstein, who is set to appear in James Gunn's <em>Creature Commandos</em>.

                    <p>
                        Perhaps his most notable run was a long tenure as the primary artist on **Geoff Johns' <em>Green Lantern</em>** during massive events like **Blackest Night**, visually realizing the complex, emotional spectrum-powered universe. Mahnke's passion for art is matched by his personal interest in weightlifting, holding Masters National and world titles, which subtly influences the powerful anatomy of his comic book figures.

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-[#541809]">Interview & Commentary</h3>
                    <!-- Video description based on search results/video title -->
                    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">In this segment of the interview, Doug Mahnke discusses his art process, confirming he primarily works traditionally on a drawing board because his wrist action and posture are not conducive to digital tablets like Procreate, which he only uses for animation and sketches. He talks about his collaborative process, noting that penciling a standard page takes him roughly four to six hours. Mahnke highlights his love for his work on the <em>Green Lantern</em> run with Geoff Johns due to the variety and cosmic scope of the stories, and praises his frequent collaborator **Peter J. Tomasi**, noting their shared influences result in a complementary style that was perfect for both <em>Black Adam: The Dark Age</em> and their critically acclaimed run on <em>Detective Comics</em>.</p>
