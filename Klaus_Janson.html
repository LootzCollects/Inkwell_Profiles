                        <b>Klaus Janson</b> is a German-American comic book artist widely regarded as one of the most influential inkers in the industry's history. He began his career in the early 1970s, making his professional debut in 1973 for Marvel Comics' <b><i>Jungle Action</i></b>. His career truly took off through his long-running partnership with **Frank Miller**, starting on <b><i>Daredevil</i></b> in the mid-70s, where he quickly transitioned from being a standard inker to handling layouts and finishes.

                        The pinnacle of their collaboration came in 1986 with **DC Comics** on the groundbreaking limited series, **<i>Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</i>**. Jansonâ€™s heavy, gritty inking style was crucial in establishing the book's stark, noir aesthetic, which forever changed the tone and scope of mainstream superhero comics. He later returned to the franchise to work on **<i>The Dark Knight III: The Master Race</i>**.

                    <p>
                        Beyond his inking mastery, Janson is a respected penciler and educator, having taught sequential storytelling at the **School of Visual Arts** in New York City since the 1990s. He codified much of his knowledge in the acclaimed instructional book **<i>The DC Comics Guide to Inking Comics</i>** (2003). He continues to contribute to both Marvel and DC, having worked on nearly every major title including <b><i>The Amazing Spider-Man</i></b>, <b><i>Punisher</i></b>, and recent collaborations with **John Romita Jr.**

He provides an in-depth look at his collaboration with **Frank Miller** on **<i>The Dark Knight Returns</i>** and discusses how that revolutionary series created the first second printing in comic history. Janson also offers insight into the importance of inking as a unique art form in sequential storytelling.</p>
