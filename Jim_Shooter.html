                    <p>
                        Jim Shooter began his storied and controversial career as a prodigy, selling **Legion of Super-Heroes** stories to DC Comics at the age of 14. He became a seminal figure during his tenure as Marvel Comics’ Editor-in-Chief (1978–1987), where he transformed the company's organizational and financial health. Shooter systematically tackled the "Dreaded Deadline Doom," implemented the first-ever creator royalty system, and championed the development of the Direct Market. Creatively, he oversaw Marvel's most famous and complex storylines of the era, including *The Dark Phoenix Saga* and *Demon in a Bottle*, and wrote the industry-shaking *Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars*.

                    <p>
                        Post-Marvel, Shooter co-founded **Valiant Comics** in 1989, securing the rights to classic Gold Key characters like *Magnus, Robot Fighter* and *Solar, Man of the Atom*. He built Valiant's interconnected universe, which became the hottest new publisher of the early 1990s. Although known for his brusque and strict managerial style, his business sense and vision are credited with elevating the financial standing of comics creators. His career is marked by bold moves, including securing highly successful tie-in licenses for *GI Joe* and *Transformers* and pioneering the first direct-sales-only series (*Dazzler* #1), forever changing the comic distribution model.

                    <!-- Video summary paragraph -->
                    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">In this discussion, Jim Shooter recounts his pivotal role in developing the comic industry's Direct Market, revealing how he secretly tracked sales data and realized the viability of publishing exclusively for comic shops, leading to the launch of *Dazzler* #1. He details how his persistence was key in obtaining the Gold Key licenses (*Magnus*, *Solar*) after leaving Marvel, holding off competitors like Mike Richardson (Dark Horse) and DC/Marvel executives. Shooter explains that the explosive success of his venture was due to having a strong publishing plan combined with a cooperative team, which led to *Harbinger* taking off and the massive success of the *Unity* crossover event, positioning Valiant as the "hottest thing in comics." He candidly explains that his strategy was driven by a need to fix the declining comic sales model, believing strongly that consistent quality and accessibility for new readers were necessary to save the industry.</p>
