                        Brian Azzarello is one of modern comics' most distinguished writers, renowned for his bleak, hardboiled voice and unflinching commitment to the crime-noir genre. A native of Cleveland, Ohio, Azzarello's writing career took off in the late 1990s and early 2000s, establishing him as a master of intricate, morally ambiguous narratives. His work frequently explores themes of justice, corruption, and the consequences of violence, often delivered through stylized, sharp-edged dialogue.

                    <p>
                        His definitive work is the Vertigo series **"100 Bullets"** (1999–2009), created with artist Eduardo Risso. The critically acclaimed series—which spanned 100 issues and earned multiple Eisner and Harvey Awards—is a complex web of crime, revenge, and conspiracy centered around a mysterious briefcase that offers the recipient a gun and 100 untraceable bullets. Beyond his creator-owned success, Azzarello has lent his distinctive voice to DC Comics icons, reshaping the character of Wonder Woman during the New 52 era and penning the dark, controversial graphic novels *Joker* and *Batman: Damned* with collaborator Lee Bermejo.
