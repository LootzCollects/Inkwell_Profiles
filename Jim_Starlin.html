                        Jim Starlin is widely regarded as the creator who established the cosmic corner of the Marvel Universe, infusing space opera with philosophical and existential themes. His career launched in the early 1970s, where he quickly introduced the characters that would become central to his legacy: the nihilistic villain **Thanos** and the anti-heroes Gamora and Drax the Destroyer in *Iron Man* #55. Starlin's style evolved from the dynamic action of his early superhero work into a complex, psychedelic approach focused on grand scale and internal struggles, particularly during his acclaimed run writing and drawing *Captain Marvel* and *Warlock*.

                    <p>
                        His most famous contribution is the **Infinity Saga**, beginning with *The Infinity Gauntlet* and continuing through *War* and *Crusade*. This epic narrative saw Thanos collect the Infinity Gems to challenge the universe itself, laying the foundation for the most successful narrative arc in the history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (*Avengers: Infinity War* and *Endgame*). Beyond Marvel, Starlin also did significant work for DC Comics, including writing and drawing *Batman: A Death in the Family*, where the second Robin, Jason Todd, was killed. Starlin is renowned for his ability to merge blockbuster action with deep character psychology and metaphysical concepts.

                    <!-- Video summary paragraph -->
                    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">In this 2019 interview, Jim Starlin discusses the bizarre reality of seeing his cosmic creations—Thanos, Drax, and Gamora—become global, cinematic icons nearly 50 years after their creation. He humorously recounts the process of creating Thanos, initially inspired by Jack Kirby's Darkseid but quickly evolved into the Mad Titan. Starlin emphasizes the deeply personal nature of his work, revealing that many of the psychological and philosophical struggles faced by his characters, particularly Warlock, were a reflection of his own experiences and his struggles with suicidal thoughts after returning from the Vietnam War. He notes the creative satisfaction of working with DC Comics on *Cosmic Odyssey* and the challenges of managing creative integrity under various editorial regimes, but ultimately expresses gratitude for the opportunity to have told these monumental, enduring stories.</p>
