                    <p>
                        <b>Tyler Kirkham</b> is a <b>New York Times</b> best-selling artist and creator known for his powerful sequential storytelling and energetic art style, which is often reminiscent of the Image Comics era that inspired him. Growing up in Utah, Kirkham initially pursued a career in baseball before an injury shifted his focus entirely to art. After starting with paid gigs drawing local newspaper cartoons, he gained a crucial internship at <b>Marc Silvestri’s Top Cow Studios</b> soon after high school.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through the network built at <b>Top Cow</b>, Kirkham secured work at <b>Marvel Comics</b> and later signed an exclusive deal with <b>DC Comics</b>. At <b>DC</b>, he established himself with long runs on major titles, including <b><i>Green Lantern Corps</i></b> (where he focused on Kyle Rayner and the various Corps members), <b><i>Deathstroke</i></b>, and <b><i>Teen Titans</i></b>. His distinctive style, characterized by intricate linework and explosive action, made him a highly requested cover artist for numerous publishers, including Marvel, where he worked on titles like <b><i>The Amazing Spider-Man</i></b>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        More recently, Kirkham has moved into the role of writer/creator, launching his fully creator-owned independent series, <b><i>Final Boss</i></b>. This new venture is a direct homage to the beat-'em-up arcade games and action films of the 1980s and 90s, combining high-octane action with video game-inspired stat-leveling mechanics. Kirkham balances his professional career with his family life in Utah, using a combination of traditional and digital tools to produce his art.
