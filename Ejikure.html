                    <p>
                        Ejikure Wee Kiat, known simply as Ejikure, is a highly popular cover artist from Singapore. His work is characterized by a sleek, dynamic digital style often focused on clean lines, vibrant colors, and expressive character poses, making him a fixture in the modern variant cover market. He is closely associated with Stanley "Artgerm" Lau's PUREart brand and frequently collaborates on covers for major publishers including Marvel, DC, and Image Comics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While celebrated for his digital proficiency on titles like *Birds of Prey* and *Mighty Morphin Power Rangers / Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II*, Ejikure maintains a deep commitment to mastering traditional artistic techniques. He is known to use platforms like Art Trober (Inktober) not for posting final, polished digital work, but as a dedicated opportunity to experiment with physical mediums, including Copic markers and traditional inks. This continuous quest to find his unique "voice" outside of the speed and predictability of digital art makes him a respected figure among his peers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ejikure's work is collected for its aesthetic appeal and versatility across different genres, from superhero action (such as his popular Marvel variants) to the playful character designs found in his *Street Fighter* illustrations. His commitment to craft, even while balancing a busy work schedule, underscores his influence as a modern comic book illustrator.

                    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">In this joint stream with artist Derrick Chew, Ejikure discusses their collaborative cover set for *Power Rangers*, noting that he was assigned the Omega Rangers while Derrick drew the Mighty Morphin team. He expresses that he and Derrick loved the franchise and enjoyed tackling the challenge of balancing the character count for the connecting cover. Ejikure also shared insights into his art practice, revealing he doesn't post his Inktober/Art Trober work publicly because he uses that time to experiment with traditional mediums to develop a unique style without the pressure of chasing social media engagement.</p>
