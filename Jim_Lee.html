                    <p>
                        Jim Lee is one of the most recognizable and influential artists in modern comics, known for his **hyper-detailed, dynamic, and muscular** style that defined an era. Born in South Korea, he initially pursued a career in medicine to honor his father, graduating with a degree in psychology from Princeton before deciding to take a year off to pursue his true passion: comic book art. His breakthrough came at Marvel Comics in the late 1980s, culminating in his co-writing and illustrating *X-Men* Vol. 2 #1 in 1991, which remains the best-selling single comic issue of all time (over 8 million copies).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Driven by a desire for creator ownership, Lee co-founded **Image Comics** in 1992 and established his own studio, WildStorm Productions, launching popular titles like *WildC.A.T.s* and *Gen¹³*. After selling WildStorm to DC Comics in 1998, Lee became an exclusive DC artist, producing acclaimed runs such as *Batman: Hush* and *Superman: For Tomorrow*. He was a driving force behind the *New 52* initiative, redesigning the core DC cast. Today, Lee serves as the President, Publisher, and Chief Creative Officer of DC Comics, continuing to shape the company both creatively and corporately.

                    <!-- Video summary paragraph -->
                    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">In this segment, Jim Lee speaks candidly about the intense pressure he faced from his Korean immigrant parents to follow his father into medicine, viewing it as the path to security. He discusses how comics, especially **Superman** (the ultimate immigrant), provided sanctuary and helped him assimilate into American culture as a child. He recounts graduating from Princeton and making a high-stakes deal with his family to dedicate just one year to achieving his dream of being a professional comic book artist. He committed to drawing eight to ten hours a day, often battling physical soreness, eventually proving his dedication to himself and his parents, a commitment he attributes as essential to his subsequent success.</p>
