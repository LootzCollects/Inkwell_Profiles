                        Joe Kelly (<i>Joseph Kelly</i>) is an acclaimed American comic book <b>writer, editor, and co-creator</b> of the <i>Man of Action</i> creative studio. He is noted for his complex character work and ability to inject both high-concept superhero action and deeply personal drama into his stories. He began his career in <b>1995</b> as a graduate of the Marvel/NYU "Stan-Hattan Project" writing workshop. His early work for Marvel included a transformative run on <i>Deadpool</i>, where he defined the character's signature blend of dark humor, fourth-wall breaking, and emotional depth, which is still considered the industry standard and heavily influences the character's depiction in other media.

He later returned to Marvel for the <i>Brand New Day</i> era of <i>Amazing Spider-Man</i>, penning memorable arcs like <b>"Rage of the Rhino"</b> and <b>"Grim Hunt."</b> Beyond mainstream comics, Kelly has earned critical acclaim for original graphic novels such as <i>I Kill Giants</i> and <i>Four Eyes</i>.
