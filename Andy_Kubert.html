                        Andy Kubert is a highly esteemed American comic book artist known for his powerful, cinematic art style that has been instrumental in defining the look of both Marvel and DC's flagship characters since the 1990s. As the son of comic legend Joe Kubert and brother of Adam Kubert, he is part of a storied artistic dynasty, inheriting a commitment to strong storytelling and draftsmanship. Andy graduated from his father's school and quickly established himself, initially at DC Comics before moving to Marvel.

                    <p>
                        He is best known for his influential work on Marvel's **X-Men**, where he took over as the primary penciler following Jim Lee and helped define the look of the franchise throughout the decade. His distinctive style—characterized by fluid anatomy, detailed environments, and dynamic fight choreography—made him a natural choice for major events. Later, he moved back to DC Comics, where he became a key figure on titles like *Batman* and *Superman*, and penciled the pivotal DC Universe event, **Flashpoint**.
