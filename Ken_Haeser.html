                    <p>
                        Ken Haeser is an American comic book writer and artist best known for his distinct macabre and often humorous art style, heavily influenced by the horror genre. Based in New Jersey, Haeser is a prolific artist who works primarily in traditional media (pencil and ink), though he uses digital tools for coloring. He has been drawing since childhood, finding passion in the visual arts as a way to express himself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Haeser is the co-creator of the independent horror series **<i>The Living Corpse</i>** (originally from Dynamite Entertainment), which follows the dark adventures of a reanimated dead man. However, he is arguably most famous in the collecting community for his immense volume of **hand-drawn sketch covers** and <b>homage variant covers</b> for publishers like Dynamite. His covers often reference classic artwork by legendary creators like **Todd McFarlane** and **Mike Zeck**, applying his unique style to characters ranging from horror icons (like Jason and Freddy Krueger) to popular superheroes (like Spider-Man and Batman).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        His work on various popular franchises, including <b><i>Grumpy Cat</i></b>, <b><i>Darkwing Duck</i></b>, and covers for DC and Marvel characters, showcases his versatility. He has also partnered with major subscription box companies like Bam! Box, creating exclusive art sets based on themes like **Stephen King** and Universal Monsters, bringing his distinct aesthetic to a wide audience of collectors.
