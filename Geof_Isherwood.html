                    <p>
                        Geof Isherwood is an American-Canadian comic book illustrator with a career spanning over four decades, known for his detailed, expressive art style across both superhero and fantasy genres. After graduating from Concordia University in Montreal, he began his career at Marvel Comics in 1982. Isherwood's deep interest in sword and sorcery led him to significant runs on titles like *Conan the Barbarian* and *Conan the King*. His detailed backgrounds and expressive character work became a hallmark of his style, which he believes is essential for immersing the reader in the story's setting, especially in the Hyborian Age.

                        At DC Comics, he was a key artistic contributor to the original *Suicide Squad* run (as inker and later penciller) and illustrated the critically acclaimed *Doctor Strange* (where he also did writing). Isherwood is one of the few artists to have worked on Robert E. Howard's most famous character, Conan, across three different magazine formats: the original *Savage Sword of Conan*, *Conan the Savage*, and the modern Titan Comics revival of *Savage Sword of Conan* (starting in 2024). He also spent years working in film as a storyboard artist and concept illustrator for productions like *Battlefield Earth* and two *X-Men* films.

                    <!-- Video description -->
                    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">In this lengthy interview, Geof Isherwood shares anecdotes from his 40-year career. He details how he began at Marvel by walking into the offices and how editor Larry Hama taught him the critical importance of panel composition and visual storytelling using the "Marvel Method." Regarding his new two-part *Savage Sword of Conan* story (with Jason Aaron), he emphasizes that his greatest priority is narrative sequencing, ensuring the art tells the story even without dialogue, and he meticulously works to avoid static art. He explains that his newest *Conan* work marks a return to interiors that he loves, showing what publishers "could have had" in the years he wasn't asked to draw the barbarian. He reveals he drew a chilling scene of dead bodies by referencing **barbecued chicken drumsticks** to accurately depict burnt flesh, showcasing his commitment to visual authenticity, however grim the subject matter.</p>
