                    <p>
                        Dafne Keen is a Spanish-British actress who has become an iconic figure for modern comic book fans due to her powerful, breakthrough performance as 'Laura Kinney, the mutant clone known as X-23', in the 2017 neo-Western superhero film, 'Logan'. At just 12 years old, Keen received widespread critical acclaim for her largely non-verbal portrayal, successfully capturing the character's feral intensity, pain, and profound innocence, thereby setting a new benchmark for youth performances in the superhero genre.

                    <p>
                        Her indelible connection to the character and the comic book mythology has only solidified with her return to the role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film, 'Deadpool & Wolverine' (2024). This reprise cemented X-23's place in the modern cinematic universe and excited fans who recognize Keen as the definitive live-action version of the character. Her performance in the 'Deadpool & Wolverine' film, where X-23 is confirmed to be the same Laura from 'Logan', has led to her signature being highly sought after on related comic book issues, particularly variants of 'X-23: Deadly Regenesis #1', demonstrating her direct, tangible influence on the collector market.

                    <p>
                        Keen continues to express a strong public desire to further explore the character of X-23 within the MCU, positioning herself as a dedicated and essential part of the X-Men's cinematic future. Beyond the comic world, she is also known for her lead role as Lyra Belacqua in the critically acclaimed HBO/BBC series 'His Dark Materials'.
