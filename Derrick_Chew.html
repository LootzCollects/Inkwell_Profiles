                        Derrick Chew, also known by his alias **DCWJ**, is a Singaporean freelance artist specializing in vibrant character illustration and concept art. Chew is one of the most sought-after cover artists in the industry today, recognized for his distinct style that seamlessly fuses the dynamism and energy of Western superhero art with the smooth, detailed aesthetic of Japanese anime. His work often focuses on iconic female characters, bringing a fresh, modern sensuality and visual flair to classic heroes and villains.

                    <p>
                        Prior to his rise as a dominant cover artist for the major publishers, Chew refined his craft working as a Senior Artist for Imaginary Friends Studios and contributing character and concept art for major gaming and entertainment companies including Games Workshop and Square Enix. His transition into the comic book market saw him quickly become known for producing highly valued variant covers for DC Comics and Marvel Comics on titles such as <em>Harley Quinn</em>, <em>Catwoman</em>, <em>Captain Marvel</em>, and various Spider-Man books.

                        Chew’s influence in the comic industry is particularly strong in the variant cover market, where his pieces command high interest due to his attention to detail, striking poses, and masterful lighting. He focuses on creating images that tell a story, preferring poses that suggest characters are "in the middle of something" rather than standing statically, making his artwork instantly engaging and memorable.

                    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">In this 2020 interview, Derrick Chew discusses his creative process and challenges. He shares the immense pressure of succeeding Stanley "Artgerm" Lau on the <em>Supergirl</em> cover run, which motivated him to find new emotional dimensions to the character, such as showing her determined side. He also explains the technical difficulties of painting all-black costumes (like Catwoman’s), where achieving variation requires careful rendering of material and light. Chew emphasizes his artistic preference for dynamic posing and lighting to enhance a character's "cool factor."</p>
