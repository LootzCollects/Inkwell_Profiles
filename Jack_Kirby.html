                    <p>
                        Jack Kirby (born Jacob Kurtzberg) is widely known as the foundational architect of the superhero genre and "The King of Comics." A prolific and self-taught artist, he co-created literally hundreds of iconic characters across Marvel (originally Timely Comics) and DC Comics over five decades. Kirby's art style is instantly recognizable, characterized by a unique visual language featuring exaggerated anatomy, explosive motion, dramatic forced perspective, and cosmic power illustrated through the now-famous "Kirby Krackle"—a way of drawing energy that seems to burst off the page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Kirby's career began in the late 1930s in animation and newspaper syndicates before his seminal partnership with **Joe Simon**, where they co-created Captain America in 1941. After serving in World War II, Kirby and Simon invented the Romance comics genre with titles like *Young Romance*. In the 1960s, collaborating with Stan Lee, Kirby co-created the backbone of the Marvel Universe, including *The Fantastic Four*, *The X-Men*, *The Hulk*, *Thor*, and *The Avengers*. His work defined the visual grandeur of the Silver Age.

                    <p>
                        In 1970, Kirby moved to DC Comics, where he wrote and drew his ambitious, but ultimately unfinished, "Fourth World" saga, which introduced cosmic characters such as **Darkseid** and **Mister Miracle**, characters that remain cornerstones of the DC Universe. Despite his unquestioned creative genius, Kirby famously left Marvel over creative differences and the lack of authorship credit and intellectual property rights—a struggle that galvanized the subsequent creator's rights movement in the industry.

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-[#541809]">Interview & Commentary</h3>
                    <!-- Video description -->
                    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">In this rare interview, Jack Kirby shares his fundamental artistic philosophy and his drive for innovation across genres.</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4 text-gray-700">
                        <li>**Universal Appeal:** Kirby explains that his artwork is popular because "it connects with the ordinary man and they can understand it very easily." He deliberately created characters who were "very human" in their motivations so that "the next guy recognizes himself in any character I draw."</li>
                        <li>**The Fantastic Four:** He recalls the team book giving him "a chance to draw teenagers once more" and describes Reed Richards' stretching ability as spectacular.</li>
                        <li>**Captain America:** He firmly states that *Captain America* "just had to come into being" due to the patriotic fervor surrounding World War II, and that the hero "still is" the symbol of what America stands for.</li>
                        <li>**Cosmic Characters & Mythology:** Kirby discusses creating the **New Gods** because he felt it was "time to create a new kind of Legend" for his readership, arguing that all human myths and legends reflect this universal desire.</li>
                        <li>**Timelessness:** He predicts his creations will "probably become Classics that'll go into the 22nd century because they're Timeless."</li>
                        <li>**Early Career:** He mentions his initial work in animation (Fleischer Studios, on *Betty Boop* and *Popeye*), his partnership with **Joe Simon**, and his innovation in co-creating the romance comics genre.</li>
