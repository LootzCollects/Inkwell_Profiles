                    <p>
                        Kendrick Lim, known professionally as "Kunkka," is a highly influential illustrator and concept artist who seamlessly bridges the gap between video game art and comic book covers. He began his creative career as a game designer in Tokyo before co-founding **Imaginary Friends Studios (IFS)** in 2005 alongside artists <b>Stanley Lau</b> and **Kai Lim**. IFS quickly established itself as a premier art studio in Asia, producing art for major clients across the gaming, film, and comic industries, including Sony Online Entertainment, Capcom, Square-Enix, and DC Comics.

                    <p>
                        Kunkka gained immense popularity and acclaim within the gaming community for his dynamic loading screen artwork and official contributions to the <b><i>Defense of the Ancients (DotA)</i></b> game series, where his work earned him the high honor of having an official in-game hero, **Admiral Kunkka**, named after him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the comic industry, Kunkka is renowned for his detailed and painterly cover illustrations, contributing highly sought-after variant covers to major publishers. He has worked extensively with Marvel, drawing characters like **Carnage**, **Venom**, **Wolverine**, and **Ghost Rider**, and with DC, featuring on titles such as <b><i>Harley Quinn</i></b>, **Batman**, and **Poison Ivy**. His style is characterized by high energy, detailed rendering, and a fusion of Western comic sensibilities with Asian illustration aesthetics.
